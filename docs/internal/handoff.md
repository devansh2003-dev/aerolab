## 0. Latest turns (uncommitted)

### 0a. 2026-06-11 — Re=20 sphere drag diagnosis (this turn)

Diagnosed the open Re=20 sphere +47% drag discrepancy flagged in §0b as the
blocker for a sphere Cd-vs-Re chart. Ran a 9-agent adversarial diagnostic
workflow (`wf_c264991f-910`, ~364k tokens). **Full writeup:
[`docs/internal/sphere_re20_drag_diagnosis.md`](sphere_re20_drag_diagnosis.md)
(NEW this turn).**

- **Verdict (low confidence on the split):** NOT one clean cause and NOT a bug.
  Two roughly co-equal contributors at Re=20 — (1) finite-Re **wall confinement**
  (sphere fat vs duct, a/R=0.25; Stokes reservoir ~1.98) and (2) a **low-Re
  limitation of the simplified momentum-exchange force** (MYSL q-lever ~3-4×
  weaker at low Re via TRT s_minus; 70%-viscous regime). Which is larger is
  genuinely undetermined from existing data.
- **Confidently ruled out:** reference value (CGW correct, 2.715/1.087), temporal
  convergence (Cd grid- and step-invariant), grid/BL resolution (Re=20 BL ~9
  cells vs Re=100 ~4 — the "broken" point is *better* resolved), Mach (~0.6%,
  Re-symmetric).
- **Corrects a documented repo claim:** the "blockage does not dominate"
  conclusion (`src/forces_3d.py` docstring ~14-25, `VALIDATION.md` §8.3.x) was
  **Re=100-only AND confounded** (the low-blockage sweep also changed Nx 96→160,
  mixing lateral confinement with streamwise wake-truncation). It does NOT
  transfer to Re=20, where confinement is ~5-8× stronger. The Re=100 "+6.4%
  validated" point is itself ~6% residual confinement, not a clean anchor.
- **The one experiment that resolves it (~2h CPU, Option A):** a Re=20 lateral-
  blockage sweep at D=20 (B=25% vs B=12.5%, only the lateral width changes —
  avoids the Nx confound). Falsifiable: Cd drops toward CGW ⇒ confinement-
  dominated; barely moves ⇒ force-method-dominated. Exact recipe in the diagnosis
  doc §4.
- **Do NOT** back-solve a K_wall=1.474 "correction" — it's the cylinder-square-Cd
  tautology trap again, it's above any defensible estimate, and it breaks the
  Re=100 point (+11%).
- **Sphere-chart implication / strategic fork (your call):** (i) build a thin
  honest 2-point chart now [Re=100 validated + Re=20 "reported, not validated",
  like the cylinder Re=500 tail]; (ii) run Option A first (~2h) then label Re=20
  correctly; or (iii) invest ~10h in a real multi-Re sphere curve. Recommended
  (ii). Honest claim until then: "3D sphere validated at Re=100; characterised
  but not validated at Re=20."
- **Side finding (minor):** three near-duplicate "CGW Re=20" values float around
  (hardcoded 2.728 / documented Clift-Gauvin formula ~2.70 / piecewise 2.715),
  all <1% apart. Consolidate to one canonical formula when a sphere correlation
  is added to `references.py` — deferred, needs your call on the canonical
  variant. Doesn't move any conclusion.
- **No code or solver changes this turn.** Only the new internal diagnosis doc +
  this handoff entry. Nothing pushed.

### 0b. 2026-06-11 — Cd-vs-Re validation chart

Prompted by a comparison with another solo project (**Turblyze**: steady-state
SIMPLE / k-ω SST C++ solver, validated with a clean sphere-Cd-vs-Re curve over
Morrison 2013). Takeaway borrowed: an over-the-curve Cd(Re) chart is a stronger
validation asset than a table. Built the honest cylinder version.

- **NEW `scripts/plot_cd_vs_re.py`** — reads the committed validation JSONs only
  (no solver runs), writes **`data/validation/cylinder_cd_vs_re.png`**.
  Williamson 1996 free-stream Cd(Re) line + AeroLab Resolved (D=40) corrected
  headline points (Re 100/200/500, annotated with signed error) + Validation
  (D=20) corrected cross-check points, with the Re≤200 validated band shaded and
  the 2D-limit region labelled "reported, not claimed". Reference values pull
  from `src.references.CYLINDER_FREESTREAM_CD` so the line can't drift.
- **Data reality check (important):** the *true* Turblyze analog is a **3D sphere**
  Cd-vs-Re over Clift-Grace-Weber. AeroLab has only **2 sphere Re** on the
  apples-to-apples method (D=40 MYSL): Re=100 **+6.4%** ✓, Re=20 **+47.4%** ✗.
  A sphere curve needs (a) diagnosing the Re=20 +47% point first, (b) a
  CGW/Schiller-Naumann continuous correlation added to `references.py` (none
  today — tables are cylinder/square only), (c) a ~10 h offline multi-Re sweep
  (~2 h/run, no GPU). Parked behind that decision.
- **Doc embeds landed (2026-06-11):** PNG embedded at the top of README §Validation
  (between the badges and the wall of validation prose) and in VALIDATION.md §3.2
  (immediately under the Resolved-sweep heading, above the headline table).
  `tests/test_doc_validation_consistency.py` still green — the gate parses pipe-
  table rows, not image markdown or italic captions.
- **Not yet done:** diagnose the Re=20 sphere +47% point (open accuracy bug
  gating any sphere curve build); decide on the ~10 h sphere sweep; optional
  Turblyze post comment.

## 1. Landed in audit-3 cycle (v1.7.5, pushed + released 2026-06-11)

External audit #3 cycle closed. **35 audit items** shipped across four
commits, tagged `v1.7.5`, GitHub Release published as Latest. No
solver or accuracy changes; reliability under Cloud load, input
validation, untested-branch test coverage, consumer UX.

### Commit chain

1. **`2ac6fb2`** — main batch: 25 items (B-1/2/3/4, C-1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/
   9/10/11/12/13/14/16/18/19/20, D-1/3/5/7/15/16).
2. **`5811b86`** — CHANGELOG + handoff log of the main batch.
3. **`ff8f0f3`** — bundled-bug recoveries (D-8 `n_frames<=0` guard, D-9
   `default=float` for np.float64 in `canonical_param_hash`, D-10a/b/c
   smoke / Q-criterion defensive asserts, D-12 canvas Clear/Undo
   polygon clear).
4. **`9afe45b`** — follow-up sub-items (D-2 slider/3D card min 0.10
   m/s, D-11a display % cap, D-11b `target_extent_cells < 2.0`
   ValueError, D-11c skimage threshold divide-warning suppression).
5. **`4a015e0`** — CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` → `[1.7.5]` promotion +
   bundled-bug + follow-up sub-item sections.

Full per-item rationale in `CHANGELOG.md` `[1.7.5]` section.

### Genuinely skipped (decided not to do)

- **C-15** GIF palette quantisation (needs perf measurement).
- **C-17** float16 snapshots (invasive; 2D precedent doesn't transfer).
- **D-4 / D-6 / D-13 / D-14** pure comment drift / dead code / test
  hygiene with no UX impact.

## 1b. Previously landed (v1.7.4, 2026-06-04)

10-task pre-launch fix sprint + validator follow-up. No solver changes;
all edits in `app.py`, page config, internal-docs layout. Tagged
v1.7.4 + GitHub Release published as Latest.

### Changes (uncommitted)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `app.py` (line 77-86) | TASK 7: `page_title="AeroLab — Browser-Based CFD"`, `page_icon="🌀"`. |
| `app.py` (line 358) | Version chip `v1.7.3` → `v1.7.4`. |
| `app.py` (line 1234-1257) | DEFENSIVE: flow-speed slider now uses `setdefault` + `key=` only (drops `value=_v_state`), aligning with selectbox pattern. Validator hypothesis for "silent no-op" on card clicks. |
| `app.py` (line 1273-1284) | TASK 5: snap caption mirrors AoA style — `Re ≈ 17 snapped to baked Re = 20`. |
| `app.py` (line 1290-1304) | DEFENSIVE: viz_mode radio now uses `setdefault` + `key=` only (drops `index=0`). Same fix as slider. |
| `app.py` (line 1479-1484) | TASK 6: `_trace_streamlines` wrapped in `st.spinner(":material/refresh: Tracing streamlines...")`. |
| `app.py` (~line 1995) | TASK 4: shape-dependent camera eye/lookat — sphere & cylinder pulled back (`1.50, 0.95, 0.55` vs `0.82, 0.62, 0.48` for wings) so wake visible from first render. |
| `app.py` (line 2071-2086) | TASK 6: progress bar `.empty()` deferred until AFTER `st.plotly_chart` (was: before). Closes the blank gap between trace progress and chart paint; the "Rendering in your browser…" indicator itself is sub-second. |
| `app.py` (line 2075-2084) | TASK 3: `st.plotly_chart(..., key="gallery_3d_plotly")`. Preserves camera through Plotly's animation loop. Does NOT preserve camera across control-change reruns -- known limitation, see below. |
| `app.py` (line 2141-2180) | TASK 1: gallery cards use `on_click=_apply_3d_gallery_card` callback (was inline `if st.button(...):` which crashed with `StreamlitAPIException`). |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | New `[1.7.4]` section above v1.7.3. |
| `handoff.md` | This file. |
| `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` (NEW) | TASK 9+10: pre-launch verification + UptimeRobot setup. |
| `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.7.4.md` (NEW) | TASK 2: GitHub release form markdown block. |
| `docs/internal/3D_RESEARCH_PLAN.md` | TASK 8: `git mv` from root. |
| `docs/internal/3D_PHASE0_DECISIONS.md` | TASK 8: `git mv` from root. |
| `docs/internal/3D_PHASE0_FINDINGS.md` | TASK 8: `git mv` from root. |
| `docs/internal/3D_ACCURACY_PUSH_PLAN.md` | TASK 8: `git mv` from root. |
| `docs/internal/future-ideas/cfd_convergence_predictor.md` | TASK 8: `git mv` from `future-ideas/`. `future-ideas/` deleted. |

### Validator confirmation + follow-up fix (2026-06-04)

Validator manually re-tested on v1.7.4 localhost build. Results:

- ✅ All 6 preset cards load their scenes correctly (no crash, no no-op).
  The defensive slider/radio cleanup landed before testing — can't
  isolate whether the cleanup was load-bearing or whether the
  on_click pattern alone would have worked. Either way the cards now
  function as designed.
- ✅ Tab title + 🌀 favicon.
- ✅ Sphere/cylinder pulled-back framing.
- ✅ Flow-speed snap caption (`Re ≈ 1500 snapped to baked Re = 100
  (20, 40, 100 available).`).
- ✅ 2D regression check passes.
- ❌ **Camera persistence on viz toggle / AoA drag** — camera reset
  to default. `uirevision` alone was not enough; the explicit
  `camera=dict(...)` block in `fig.update_layout` was overriding the
  user orbit even with an unchanged uirevision token.
- ⚠️ **Card 5 mismatch** — *"Almost stopped (creep)"* set velocity
  0.5 m/s which gave Re ≈ 167 → snapped to Re=100 baked band.
  Blurb says *"Re ≈ 40 ... Stokes-flow limit"*. Mismatch.

### Follow-up landed in this turn

1. **`app.py` (~line 2128)** — card 5 velocity 0.5 → 0.12 m/s so
   `Re ≈ 40` matches the "creeping / Stokes flow" blurb. **WORKS**
   (validator re-confirmed: title now `SPHERE_RE40`, snap caption
   reads "Showing pre-baked Re = 40.").
2. **`app.py` (~line 1992)** — attempted camera-persistence fix
   (conditional `camera=` based on shape change) did **NOT** work.
   Validator re-tested and confirmed camera still resets on viz
   toggle / AoA / speed drag. Root cause: `st.plotly_chart` re-mounts
   the Plotly instance on each Streamlit rerun, losing browser-side
   camera state. `uirevision` only preserves state within Plotly's
   animation loop, not across re-mounts.
3. **De-scoped:** reverted the conditional `camera=` change (it didn't
   help — added complexity without behavior change). Kept stable
   `key=` and `uirevision` (still help for animation loop). Documented
   the cross-rerun reset as a known limitation in CHANGELOG.md and
   RELEASE_NOTES_v1.7.4.md. Proper fix would need `streamlit-plotly-
   events` or a custom Streamlit component; deferred to a later
   release. Mitigation: the v1.7.4 default-framing fix means every
   rerun lands on a *good* view, not a bad one.

### Push command (after final manual re-verify of camera + card 5)

Pushes both v1.7.4 commits (sprint + follow-up) in one go:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Study & Work\Personal Projects\AeroLab"; git push origin main
```

Optional: tag and push v1.7.4:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Study & Work\Personal Projects\AeroLab"; git tag -a v1.7.4 -m "v1.7.4: pre-launch UX fix sprint"; git push origin main; git push origin v1.7.4
```

## 2. To edit / pending decisions

### Immediate

- [x] ~~CI green on `2ac6fb2` / `5811b86` / `ff8f0f3`.~~ (`9afe45b` and
      `4a015e0` runs were still in-flight at handoff write — re-check
      next session via `gh run list --branch main --limit 5`.)
- [x] ~~Version bump decision.~~ v1.7.5 chosen; v1.8.0 stays reserved
      for upload-your-own-shape.
- [x] ~~Tag + cut a GitHub Release.~~ `v1.7.5` published as Latest.
- [x] ~~Re-examine the bundled-bug skips (D-8 / D-9 / D-10 / D-12).~~
      Shipped in `ff8f0f3` + `9afe45b`.
- [x] ~~Delete `LINKEDIN_BRIEF.md` (root draft, untracked).~~ Removed
      via `Remove-Item`.
- [ ] **Cloud-verify the load-bearing audit-3 fixes** once the deploy
      lands (this is the only un-ticked item from the cycle):
      B-1 (Share-then-click stickiness), B-2 (sidebar checkbox in 3D
      sub-second after first scene load; second session stays
      responsive under heavy 3D use), B-3 (warning toast on dropped
      card click — hard to force manually, watch under load), C-5 (no
      spurious OUT-OF-DATE banner after 2D→3D→2D), C-6 (pin a config,
      explore 4+ others, return — must not silently re-solve).
- [ ] Walk through `docs/internal/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` post-deploy.

### Stashed (resume after launch)

- [ ] **`v1.8.0` upload-your-own-shape**. Paused 2026-06-04 mid-implementation
  per user direction. Stash: `git stash list | grep v1.8.0`. Includes
  STL bytes parser, polygon-to-extruded-mask voxelizer, upload runtime
  with Cloud-safe baking config, test coverage. ~70 % complete.

### Deferred for next turn (low priority)

- [ ] Lower-AoA wings (±5°, ±15°) at Re=20 and Re=200 if user wants full coverage.
- [ ] Cube AoA variants at Re=20 / Re=200.
- [ ] Bluff body Re=200 revival (requires cumulant collision or Ny ≥ 128).

### High-leverage research (awaiting user direction, unchanged)

- [ ] **3D accuracy push** — `docs/internal/3D_ACCURACY_PUSH_PLAN.md` Path A/B/C, still awaiting sign-off.

### Pre-planned bakes (`VALIDATION.md §8.8`)

- [ ] D=60 / B=10% MYSL sphere bake (Re=100).
- [ ] 3D Strouhal cross-check.
- [ ] Cumulant collision implementation.

### Audit Tasks 10/11/12

- [ ] Task 10: Split app.py monolith.
- [ ] Task 11: numpy 2 × numba pin compatibility check.
- [ ] Task 12: Cloud keep-warm ping.

### Strategic decision (open)

3D-accuracy direction vs UX/visual-richness pivot.

## 3. Perfected — do not touch without explicit user sign-off

### Solver kernels (verified against literature, gated in CI)

- `src/lbm.py` — D2Q9 MRT + LES + Zou-He + Bouzidi.
- `src/forces.py` — 2D Ladd 1994 momentum exchange.
- `src/references.py` — All literature values verified.
- `src/lbm_3d_trt.py` — D3Q19 TRT, Λ=3/16. TGV gate at ±2%.
- `src/forces_3d.py:momentum_exchange_force_3d_mysl` — MYSL 2002.
- `src/lbm_3d_bouzidi.py` — Sphere q-field, Bouzidi quadratic BB.
- `src/shapes.py` — Analytic shape q-fields; NACA4 decode.
- `src/custom_shape.py` — Multi-threshold thresholding.

### Tests (~410 collected across 29 files, 401 green in fast suite as of audit-3 commit)

- `tests/test_doc_validation_consistency.py`
- `tests/test_openfoam_cross_check_consistency.py` (5 gates)
- `tests/test_validation_2d_cylinder_strouhal_lowblockage.py` (4)
- `tests/test_validation_3d_sphere_cd_d40.py` (7)
- `tests/test_validation_3d_sphere_cd_mysl_d40.py` (8)
- `tests/test_validation_3d_sphere_cd_stokes_regime.py` (6)
- `tests/test_validation_3d_sphere_cd_stokes_regime_mysl_d40.py` (7)
- `tests/test_forces_3d_mysl.py` (4)
- `tests/test_validation_3d_sphere_cd_lowblock.py` (8)

### OpenFOAM 11 cross-check infrastructure

- Full case files + 200 010-line forceCoeffs.dat: Cd=1.341, St=0.160.

### VALIDATION.md headline numbers

- §3 2D Resolved: 5–10% gaps.
- §8.3 sphere Re=100 D=20 Ladd: Cd=1.57.
- §8.3.4 D=40 MYSL **headline**: Cd=1.160 (+6.44%).
- §8.3.5 Re=20 D=40 MYSL: Cd=4.02 (+47%).

### UI behavior

- 3-tier Re banner; provenance badges; "Pre-baked snapshot" labels;
  OpenFOAM + 3D sphere callouts;
  Stash-on-sidebar-change (2D path);
  AoA slider snaps to nearest baked value;
  Speed slider spans 0.05–4.50 m/s, 4 snap-points for wings (Re=20/40/100/200).
- v1.7.4 added: Plotly camera persistence via stable `key=`,
  shape-dependent default camera framing, parallel Re snap caption,
  loading spinner during trace, custom page title + favicon.
- Audit-3 follow-up (`2ac6fb2`) added: 4 cached wrappers around the
  3D pipeline (load/streamlines/color-volume/Q-iso) so a single 3D
  session no longer starves the deployment; 3D-card velocity tuned to
  baked Re so sidebar caption matches card copy; share-then-click no
  longer reverts the next interaction; branch-tracking clears the
  stale-display stash on view/mode change.

### Documentation

- README.md, CHANGELOG.md, VALIDATION.md (14 citations).
- LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md (new v1.7.4).
- `docs/internal/` houses 3D research/planning markdown.

### Code hygiene

- Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in `src/` or `app.py`.
